### Hey there! 👋

My name is Karol, I'm currently working as a Linux System Engineer and I spend most of my time at the terminal, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently. I enjoy experimenting with various software technologies because learning and trying out new tools is fun for me.
Additionally, I'm actively expanding my knowledge in the DevOps field. I'm driven by new challenges that give me the opportunity to develop both my technical and soft skills. I believe the best way to learn is through hands-on practice, experimentation, and enjoying the process along the way.
